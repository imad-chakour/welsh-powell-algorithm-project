# Welsh-Powell Algorithm - Graph Coloring

This project implements the **Welsh-Powell Algorithm** for graph coloring. It takes a graph, applies the algorithm, and visualizes the resulting graph with color-coded nodes. The purpose of this algorithm is to assign the smallest number of colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed below)

### Python Libraries

- `networkx` - For graph creation and manipulation
- `matplotlib` - For graph visualization

You can install the required libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
